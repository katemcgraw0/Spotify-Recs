# Zodiacify

Welcome to the Zodiac Sign Guesser website! This web application is designed to guess a person's zodiac sign based on their spotify listening trends. It provides a fun and interactive way for users to discover their zodiac sign and get music recommendations.

## How It Works

1. Visit the website: [Zodiacify](zodiacify.vercel.app/)

2. Login to your spotify account.

3. Choose from 3 options: Zodiacify, View Favorite Artists, Get Music Recommendations

4. Explore the website to see what zodiac sign your music taste aligns with, view your recent listening trends, and get custom music recommendations.

## Important Note: Spotify API Integration

During the development phases of this app, users are required to log their Spotify email address with me to access the Spotify API. This integration allows extra security while still in the development phase.

Please note that this requirement is only applicable while the app is in development. Once the development phase is complete, users will be able to access the website without needing to log their email addresses with me.
